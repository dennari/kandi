@book{Ueberhuber1997,
	Abstract = {This book is the second part of a modern, two-volume introduction to numerical computation, which strongly emphasizes software aspects. It can serve as a textbook for courses on numerical analysis, particularly for engineers. The book can also be used as a reference book and it includes an extensive bibliography. The author is a well-known specialist in numerical analysis who was involved in the creation of the software package QUADPACK.},

@book{Cheney2007,
	Abstract = {Authors Ward Cheney and David Kincaid show students of science and engineering the potential computers have for solving numerical problems and give them ample opportunities to hone their skills in programming and problem solving. The text also helps students learn about errors that inevitably accompany scientific computations and arms them with methods for detecting, predicting, and controlling these errors. A more theoretical text with a different menu of topics is the authors' highly regarded NUMERICAL ANALYSIS: MATHEMATICS OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING, THIRD EDITION.},
