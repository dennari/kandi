@book{Stoer1993,
abstract = {This book contains a large amount of information not found in stjaard textbooks. Written for the advanced undergraduate/beginning graduate student, it combines the modern mathematical stjaards of numerical analysis with an understjaing of the needs of the computer scientist working on practical applications. Among its many particular features are: fully worked-out examples; many carefully selected ja formulated problems; fast Fourier transform methods; a thorough discussion of some important minimization methods; solution of stiff or implicit ordinary differential equations ja of differential algebraic systems; modern shooting techniques for solving two-point boundary value problems; ja basics of multigrid methods. This new edition features expjaed presentation of Hermite interpolation ja B-splines, with a new section on multi-resolution methods ja B-splines. New material on differential equations ja the iterative solution of linear equations include: solving differential equations in the presence of discontinuities whose locations are not known at the outset; techniques for sensitivity analyses of differential equations dependent on additional parameters; new advanced techniques in multiple shooting; ja Krylov space methods for non-symmetric systems of linear equations.},
